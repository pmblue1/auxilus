If you have any questions, suggestions, or comments, message me on Discord at Pmblue#1085. I am happy to address anything that I can. I would also love any feedback, because as I said, I am a hobby programmer, and have no formal education in programming. Thank you for your time.

It may help to note that some commands and code in there, such as the clear command, were copy/pasted from my previous projects, and I still am planning on largely changing/redoing many things like that to better fit the bot, be more optimized, ect. There are quite a few things I know I need to change/redo, though telling me anything you see still cant hurt, because I would not be surprised if I am missing something even after my testing.
